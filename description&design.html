        <h1>Summary</h1>
        <p>
            Our world is overwhelmed in plastics pollutions. Concerns about environmental issues and news related to
            microplastic pollution inspired us to start this project. our mission is to degrade micro/nano-plastics
            (PET) in the water body by genetically modified E.Coli biodegradation system that produces PETase and
            strengthens the biofilm system. This combined biodegradable system can not only degrade PET plastics but
            also attach degraded microplastics, so it will not flow away, thereby preventing it from further pollution.
            Our product would be environmentally safe and biodegradable. We surveyed the general public as well as
            professional workers so that we can have the best understanding of our project. By understanding our parts
            and going through experiments, we created the best outcome of the project, and our mission is on the way.

                        <h2>1. Background</h2>
                        <p>Plastic‘s production increased drastically from the 1950s’ and reached 322 million tons of
                            production in 2015. 1.4 billion tons of waste is produced annually, roughly 10% of which is
                            plastic<a href="#ref-1">[1]</a>. Globally, only 18% of plastics waste is recycled, and 24% is incinerated. The
                            remaining 58% are either landfilled or enter the natural environment, where plastics
                            accumulate
                            and persist for a long period (Figure 1) <a href="#ref-2">[2]</a>. It is usually broken down from larger plastic
                            pieces and could be broken down again to become microplastics, which are further degraded
                            into
                            nanoplastics <a href="#ref-3">[3]</a>.</p>

                        <h2>1.1 What is nano-/microplastics? </h2>
                        <p>Microplastic refers to any plastic particles that have a diameter less than 5mm <a href="#ref-3">[3]</a>. The
                            shortest definition of nanoparticles only concerns about their size, which is limited
                            conventionally to about 100 nm in any direction <a href="#ref-3">[3]</a>. Studies have shown that the sources of
                            nano-/ microplastics can be divided into two categories, primary and secondary sources. As
                            shown in Figure 2, primary sources, the original microplastics were initially synthesized at
                            the microscopic level and widely used in various manufacturing industries, such as
                            therapeutic agents, food science, chemical agent, and personal care products and cosmetics.
                            Secondary plastics refer to those produced by the decomposition of large plastic materials.
                            The decomposition products enter the environment due to the environmental weathering of
                            plastic objects. It is worthy that secondary microplastics are considering the major source
                            of microplastic pollution in the marine environment <a href="#ref-4">[4]</a>. </p>

                        <h2>1.2 Why we must degrade nano-/microplastics? </h2>
                        <p>With the help of agricultural runoff, wastewater treatment plants, floods, river systems,
                            etc., nano/ microplastics are transported to freshwater systems or into the ocean and
                            further diffused under the action of water currents, wind, and turbulence. Moreover, due to
                            the extremely long shelf life, the nano/microplastics are finally returning to humans
                            (Figure 2). Generally, nano-/microplastics could act as a reservoir of heavy metals,
                            microorganisms, pathogens, and other harmful substances. Due to their unique physicochemical
                            characteristics, microplastics offer a distinct surface for chemical acquisition, pollutant
                            accumulation, and microbial communities. Because of their low degradation rates,
                            microplastics can persist in the environment for decades or even centuries. The long-lasting
                            presence of microplastics in the aquatic environment is considered a threat to many aquatic
                            animals as well as the human body. </p>

                        <h2>1.2.2 Potential impacts on ecosystem</h2>
                        <p>The coastal environment, which can absorb persistent organic pollutants, are threatened by
                            microplastics. These particles, microplastics, are dangerous to marine species by exposing
                            risk on the food chain. It is acknowledged that it is simple for marine animals to absorb
                            microplastics since they are so small, which would cause terrible health problems. For
                            example, oyster’s thriving and reproducing abilities are harmed, due to the consumption of
                            microplastics. Therefore, after a long time, disruption of marine animals’ populations will
                            eventually break the delicate balance of the marine ecosystem. Now, “Over 700 species of the
                            marine organism are known to encounter plastics in the environment with clear evidence of
                            physical harm from entanglement and ingestion”, and people also worry about microplastics
                            would bring toxicological hazard to marine animals if marine animals digest those tiny
                            particles with food. Besides, it also impacts the ability to absorb the nutrients in a
                            negative way <a href="#ref-6">[6-9]</a>.
                            <br><br>
                            Microplastics have done a great deal in harming the environment due to its ability to resist
                            degradation and its level of fragmentation. It is ubiquitous and can be found everywhere.
                            Many species, marine animals the most severe, have been threatened. Even humans could be put
                            at risk. Thus, we conclude that immediate action is needed. </p>

                        <p>Except for biodegradation methods, thermal degradation, mechanical action and other much more
                            advanced methods are also feasible when deal with microplastics in sewage.
                            <br><br>
                            Normally, before degradation, the process of extraction is quite important. However, despite
                            the traditional wastewater treatments can efficiently remove microplastics, an advanced
                            treatment is still required in order to improve the removal efficiency of small-sized
                            microplastics (< 100 µm). <br><br>
                                As for other methods, heterogeneous photocatalysis process by designed photocatalysts of
                                zinc oxide nanorods (ZnO NRs) and platinum nanoparticles deposited on zinc oxide
                                nanorods (Pt NPs-ZnO NRs) under visible light irradiation are also feasible. However,
                                the light used in the experiment is halogen lamp instead of sunlight, because it can be
                                controlled and thus more stable, and the experiment is set up inside a black box for
                                maximum effectiveness. It is no use to deduce what might happen if the method is adapted
                                to the marine environment. </p>

                        <h2>2. Our solutions and design</h2>
                        <p>Here we introduce our biofilm systems which can capture PET nano-/microplastics and
                            biodegrade them at the same time. To be specific, we take E. coli (BL21) as our engineering
                            strain, strengthening its biofilms and make it able to secrete PETase at the same time. </p>

                    <div class="sec">

                        <h2>2.1 Strengthen biofilms system (BBa_K3576000)</h2>
                        <p>E. coli produces biofilms through the curli operon, which is regulated by two proteins, OmpR
                            and CsgD. Here, we only concentrate on the former. Our goal is to increase biofilm yield by
                            constitutively overexpressing OmpR <a href="#ref-12">[12]</a>. </p>
                        <img src="./assets/discription&design/3.png" style="width: 100%" />
                        <p>As shown in Figure 3, a strong T7 promoter(BBa_I712074) and strong RBS combination
                            (BBa_K880005) to maximize protein production, and a double terminator (BBa_B0015) to end
                            transcription. Therefore, by overexpressing OmpR234, biofilms could become much more sticky
                            and easy for capturing nano-/microplastics. </p>

                        <h2>2.2 PETase expression system (BBa_K3576001)</h2>
                        <p>Here, we simply introduce PETase(BBa_K1582000) to impart biodegradation ability to E.coli.
                            Besides, we also add PelB signal peptide for releasing enzymes out of the membrane and EGFP
                            for marking enzymes visible.

                        <h2>2.3 SpyTag-SpyCatcher systems</h2>
                        <p>To combine two designs mentioned above, spy system has been conducted. SpyTag is a short
                            peptide that forms an isopeptide bond upon encountering its protein partner SpyCatcher. This
                            covalent peptide interaction is a simple and powerful tool for bioconjugation <a href="#ref-13">[13]</a>.
                            Therefore, as long as they show up in each protein’s presense, they would covalently bond to
                            each other. In other words, PETase could stick to biofilms, boosting degradation
                            effieciency.</p>

                        <h2>2.4 Future plan</h2>
                        <p>However，according to the research，at room temperature，the rate of biodegradation is quiet
                            low. If we put PET to surroundings with higher temperature, the rate could certainly
                            increase significantly. However，normally，enzymes like PETase cannot survive in
                            high-temperature surrounding and therefore not being able to degrade PET. By collaborating
                            with another team (Tianjing university), we insert a part which could make PETase still
                            stable even under XXX(数据那边还没给我).
                            <br><br>
                            中间应该有一段具体的基因介绍和mechanism 天津大学还没有给到我。
                            <br><br>
                            Our second design: Briefly, modified E.coli could produce a kind of PETase with high
                            thermostability. By enzyme purification(because we also insert 6XHIS tag in our gene
                            circuit), we could put our special enzymes to high-temperature area where we put PET. Thus,
                            biodegradation system could be significantly improved. </p>
